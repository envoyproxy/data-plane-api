Schema Validator check tool
===========================

The schema validator tool validates that the passed in JSON conforms to a schema in
the configuration. To validate the entire config, please refer to the
:ref:`config load check tool<install_tools_config_load_check_tool>`. Currently, only
:ref:`route config<config_http_conn_man_route_table>` schema validation is supported.

Input
  The tool expects two inputs:

  1. The schema type to check the passed in JSON against. The supported type is:

    * `route` - for :ref:`route configuration<config_http_conn_man_route_table>` validation.

  2. The path to the JSON.

Output
  If the JSON conforms to the schema, the tool will exit with status EXIT_SUCCESS. If the JSON does
  not conform to the schema, an error message is outputted detailing what doesn't conform to the
  schema. The tool will exit with status EXIT_FAILURE.

Building
  The tool can be built locally using Bazel. ::

    bazel build //test/tools/schema_validator:schema_validator_tool

Running
  The tool takes a path as described above. ::

    bazel-bin/test/tools/schema_validator/schema_validator_tool  --schema-type SCHEMA_TYPE  --json-path PATH
