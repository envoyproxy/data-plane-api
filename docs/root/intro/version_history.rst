  configurations by default. The :ref:`include_vh_rate_limits
  <config_http_conn_man_route_table_route_include_vh>` to inherit the virtual host level options if
  desired.
* HTTP routes can now add request headers on a per route and per virtual host basis via the
  :ref:`request_headers_to_add <config_http_conn_man_headers_custom_request_headers>` option.

  external, or all requests via the `request_type` option.
