Envoy documentation
=================================

.. ifconfig:: release_level in ('pre-release')

  .. attention::

    This is pre-release documentation generated directly from
    `data-plane-api <https://github.com/envoyproxy/data-plane-api>`_. There is risk of it not
    being consistent with what is currently implemented in Envoy, though we try to make things
    consistent as quickly as possible.
