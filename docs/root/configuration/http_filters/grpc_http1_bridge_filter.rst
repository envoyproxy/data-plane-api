gRPC HTTP/1.1 bridge
====================

* gRPC :ref:`architecture overview <arch_overview_grpc>`
* :ref:`v1 API reference <config_http_filters_grpc_bridge_v1>`
* :ref:`v2 API reference <envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpFilter.name>`

This is a simple filter which enables the bridging of an HTTP/1.1 client which does not support
response trailers to a compliant gRPC server. It works by doing the following:

* When a request is sent, the filter sees if the connection is HTTP/1.1 and the request content type
  is *application/grpc*.
* If so, when the response is received, the filter buffers it and waits for trailers and then checks the
  *grpc-status* code. If it is not zero, the filter switches the HTTP response code to 503. It also copies
  the *grpc-status* and *grpc-message* trailers into the response headers so that the client can look
  at them if it wishes.
* The client should send HTTP/1.1 requests that translate to the following pseudo headers:

  * *\:method*: POST
  * *\:path*: <gRPC-METHOD-NAME>
  * *content-type*: application/grpc

* The body should be the serialized grpc body which is:

  * 1 byte of zero (not compressed).
  * network order 4 bytes of proto message length.
  * serialized proto message.

* Because this scheme must buffer the response to look for the *grpc-status* trailer it will only
  work with unary gRPC APIs.

This filter also collects stats for all gRPC requests that transit, even if those requests are
normal gRPC requests over HTTP/2.

Statistics
----------

The filter emits statistics in the *cluster.<route target cluster>.grpc.* namespace.
