Original Destination
====================

Original destination listener filter reads the SO_ORIGINAL_DST socket option set when a connection
has been redirected by an iptables REDIRECT target, or by an iptables TPROXY target in combination
with setting the listener's :ref:`transparent <envoy_api_field_Listener.transparent>` option.
Later processing in Envoy sees the restored destination address as the connection's local address,
rather than the address at which the listener is listening at. Furthermore, :ref:`an original
destination cluster <arch_overview_service_discovery_types_original_destination>` may be used to
forward HTTP requests or TCP connections to the restored destination address.
