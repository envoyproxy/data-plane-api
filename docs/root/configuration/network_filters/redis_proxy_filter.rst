Statistics
----------

Every configured Redis proxy filter has statistics rooted at *redis.<stat_prefix>.* with the
following statistics:

.. csv-table::
  :header: Name, Type, Description
  :widths: 1, 1, 2

  downstream_cx_active, Gauge, Total active connections
  downstream_cx_protocol_error, Counter, Total protocol errors
  downstream_cx_rx_bytes_buffered, Gauge, Total received bytes currently buffered
  downstream_cx_rx_bytes_total, Counter, Total bytes received
  downstream_cx_total, Counter, Total connections
  downstream_cx_tx_bytes_buffered, Gauge, Total sent bytes currently buffered
  downstream_cx_tx_bytes_total, Counter, Total bytes sent
  downstream_cx_drain_close, Counter, Number of connections closed due to draining
  downstream_rq_active, Gauge, Total active requests
  downstream_rq_total, Counter, Total requests


Splitter statistics
-------------------

The Redis filter will gather statistics for the command splitter in the
*redis.<stat_prefix>.splitter.* with the following statistics:

.. csv-table::
  :header: Name, Type, Description
  :widths: 1, 1, 2

  invalid_request, Counter, "Number of requests with an incorrect number of arguments"
  unsupported_command, Counter, "Number of commands issued which are not recognized by the
  command splitter"

Per command statistics
----------------------

The Redis filter will gather statistics for commands in the
*redis.<stat_prefix>.command.<command>.* namespace.

.. csv-table::
  :header: Name, Type, Description
  :widths: 1, 1, 2

  total, Counter, Number of commands

.. _config_network_filters_redis_proxy_per_command_stats:

Runtime
-------

The Redis proxy filter supports the following runtime settings:

redis.drain_close_enabled
  % of connections that will be drain closed if the server is draining and would otherwise
  attempt a drain close. Defaults to 100.
