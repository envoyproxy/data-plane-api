Statistics
----------

The TCP proxy filter emits both its own downstream statistics as well as many of the :ref:`cluster
upstream statistics <config_cluster_manager_cluster_stats>` where applicable. The downstream
statistics are rooted at *tcp.<stat_prefix>.* with the following statistics:

.. csv-table::
  :header: Name, Type, Description
  :widths: 1, 1, 2

  downstream_cx_total, Counter, Total number of connections handled by the filter.
  downstream_cx_no_route, Counter, Number of connections for which no matching route was found.
  downstream_cx_tx_bytes_total, Counter, Total bytes written to the downstream connection.
  downstream_cx_tx_bytes_buffered, Gauge, Total bytes currently buffered to the downstream connection.
  downstream_flow_control_paused_reading_total, Counter, Total number of times flow control paused reading from downstream.
  downstream_flow_control_resumed_reading_total, Counter, Total number of times flow control resumed reading from downstream.
