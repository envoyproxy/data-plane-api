.. _config_access_log:

Access logging
==============

Configuration
-------------------------

Access logs are configured as part of the :ref:`HTTP connection manager config
<config_http_conn_man>` or :ref:`TCP Proxy <config_network_filters_tcp_proxy>`.

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "access_log": [
      {
        "path": "...",
        "format": "...",
        "filter": "{...}",
      },
    ]
  }

.. _config_access_log_path_param:

path
  *(required, string)* Path the access log is written to.

.. _config_access_log_format_param:

format
  *(optional, string)* Access log format. Envoy supports :ref:`custom access log formats
  <config_access_log_format>` as well as a :ref:`default format
  <config_access_log_default_format>`.

.. _config_access_log_filter_param:

filter
  *(optional, object)* :ref:`Filter <config_http_con_manager_access_log_filters>` which is used to
  determine if the access log needs to be written.

.. _config_access_log_format:

Format rules
------------

The access log format string contains either command operators or other characters interpreted as a
plain string. The access log formatter does not make any assumptions about a new line separator, so one
has to specified as part of the format string.
See the :ref:`default format <config_access_log_default_format>` for an example.
Note that the access log line will contain a '-' character for every not set/empty value.

The same format strings are used by different types of access logs (such as HTTP and TCP).  Some
fields may have slightly different meanings, depending on what type of log it is.  Differences
are noted.

The following command operators are supported:

%START_TIME%
  HTTP
    Request start time including milliseconds.

  TCP
    Downstream connection start time including milliseconds.

%BYTES_RECEIVED%
  HTTP
    Body bytes received.

  TCP
    Downstream bytes received on connection.

%PROTOCOL%
  HTTP
    Protocol. Currently either *HTTP/1.1* or *HTTP/2*.

  TCP
    Not implemented ("-").

%RESPONSE_CODE%
  HTTP
    HTTP response code. Note that a response code of '0' means that the server never sent the
    beginning of a response. This generally means that the (downstream) client disconnected.

  TCP
    Not implemented ("-").

%BYTES_SENT%
  HTTP
    Body bytes sent.

  TCP
    Downstream bytes sent on connection.

%DURATION%
  HTTP
    Total duration in milliseconds of the request from the start time to the last byte out.

  TCP
    Total duration in milliseconds of the downstream connection.

%RESPONSE_FLAGS%
  Additional details about the response or connection, if any. For TCP connections, the response codes mentioned in
  the descriptions do not apply.  Possible values are:

  HTTP and TCP
    * **UH**: No healthy upstream hosts in upstream cluster in addition to 503 response code.
    * **UF**: Upstream connection failure in addition to 503 response code.
    * **UO**: Upstream overflow (:ref:`circuit breaking <arch_overview_circuit_break>`) in addition to 503 response code.
    * **NR**: No :ref:`route configured <arch_overview_http_routing>` for a given request in addition to 404 response code.
  HTTP only
    * **LH**: Local service failed :ref:`health check request <arch_overview_health_checking>` in addition to 503 response code.
    * **UT**: Upstream request timeout in addition to 504 response code.
    * **LR**: Connection local reset in addition to 503 response code.
    * **UR**: Upstream remote reset in addition to 503 response code.
    * **UC**: Upstream connection termination in addition to 503 response code.
    * **DI**: The request processing was delayed for a period specified via :ref:`fault injection <config_http_filters_fault_injection>`.
    * **FI**: The request was aborted with a response code specified via :ref:`fault injection <config_http_filters_fault_injection>`.
    * **RL**: The request was ratelimited locally by the :ref:`HTTP rate limit filter <config_http_filters_rate_limit>` in addition to 429 response code.

%UPSTREAM_HOST%
  Upstream host URL (e.g., tcp://ip:port for TCP connections).

%UPSTREAM_CLUSTER%
  Upstream cluster to which the upstream host belongs to.

%REQ(X?Y):Z%
  HTTP
    An HTTP request header where X is the main HTTP header, Y is the alternative one, and Z is an
    optional parameter denoting string truncation up to Z characters long. The value is taken from
    the HTTP request header named X first and if it's not set, then request header Y is used. If
    none of the headers are present '-' symbol will be in the log.

  TCP
    Not implemented ("-").

%RESP(X?Y):Z%
  HTTP
    Same as **%REQ(X?Y):Z%** but taken from HTTP response headers.

  TCP
    Not implemented ("-").


.. _config_access_log_default_format:

Default format
--------------

If custom format is not specified, Envoy uses the following default format:

.. code-block:: none

  [%START_TIME%] "%REQ(:METHOD)% %REQ(X-ENVOY-ORIGINAL-PATH?:PATH)% %PROTOCOL%"
  %RESPONSE_CODE% %RESPONSE_FLAGS% %BYTES_RECEIVED% %BYTES_SENT% %DURATION%
  %RESP(X-ENVOY-UPSTREAM-SERVICE-TIME)% "%REQ(X-FORWARDED-FOR)%" "%REQ(USER-AGENT)%"
  "%REQ(X-REQUEST-ID)%" "%REQ(:AUTHORITY)%" "%UPSTREAM_HOST%"\n

Example of the default Envoy access log format:

.. code-block:: none

  [2016-04-15T20:17:00.310Z] "POST /api/v1/locations HTTP/2" 204 - 154 0 226 100 "10.0.35.28"
  "nsq2http" "cc21d9b0-cf5c-432b-8c7e-98aeb7988cd2" "locations" "tcp://10.0.2.1:80"

.. _config_http_con_manager_access_log_filters:

Filters
-------

Envoy supports the following access log filters:

.. contents::
  :local:

Status code
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "filter": {
      "type": "status_code",
      "op": "...",
      "value": "...",
      "runtime_key": "..."
    }
  }

Filters on HTTP response/status code.

op
  *(required, string)* Comparison operator. Currently *>=*  and *=* are the only supported operators.

value
  *(required, integer)* Default value to compare against if runtime value is not available.

runtime_key
  *(optional, string)* Runtime key to get value for comparision. This value is used if defined.

Duration
^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "filter": {
      "type": "duration",
      "op": "..",
      "value": "...",
      "runtime_key": "..."
    }
  }

Filters on total request duration in milliseconds.

op
  *(required, string)* Comparison operator. Currently *>=* and *=* are the only supported operators.

value
  *(required, integer)* Default value to compare against if runtime values is not available.

runtime_key
  *(optional, string)* Runtime key to get value for comparision. This value is used if defined.


Not health check
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "filter": {
      "type": "not_healthcheck"
    }
  }

Filters for requests that are not health check requests. A health check request is marked by
the :ref:`health check filter <config_http_filters_health_check>`.

Traceable
^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "filter": {
      "type": "traceable_request"
    }
  }

Filters for requests that are traceable. See the :ref:`tracing overview <arch_overview_tracing>` for
more information on how a request becomes traceable.


.. _config_http_con_manager_access_log_filters_runtime:

Runtime
^^^^^^^^^
.. code-block:: json

  {
    "filter": {
      "type": "runtime",
      "key" : "..."
    }
  }

Filters for random sampling of requests. Sampling pivots on the header
:ref:`x-request-id<config_http_conn_man_headers_x-request-id>` being present. If
:ref:`x-request-id<config_http_conn_man_headers_x-request-id>` is present, the filter will
consistently sample across multiple hosts based on the runtime key value and the value extracted
from :ref:`x-request-id<config_http_conn_man_headers_x-request-id>`. If it is missing, the
filter will randomly sample based on the runtime key value.

key
  *(required, string)* Runtime key to get the percentage of requests to be sampled.
  This runtime control is specified in the range 0-100 and defaults to 0.

And
^^^

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "filter": {
      "type": "logical_and",
      "filters": []
    }
  }

Performs a logical "and" operation on the result of each filter in *filters*. Filters are evaluated
sequentially and if one of them returns false, the filter returns false immediately.

Or
^^

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "filter": {
      "type": "logical_or",
      "filters": []
    }
  }

Performs a logical "or" operation on the result of each individual filter. Filters are evaluated
sequentially and if one of them returns true, the filter returns true immediately.
