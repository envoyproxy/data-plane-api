Statistics
==========

Every connection manager has a statistics tree rooted at *http.<stat_prefix>.* with the following
statistics:

Per user agent statistics
-------------------------

Additional per user agent statistics are rooted at *http.<stat_prefix>.user_agent.<user_agent>.*
Currently Envoy matches user agent for both iOS (*ios*) and Android (*android*) and produces
the following statistics:

.. csv-table::
   :header: Name, Type, Description
   :widths: 1, 1, 2

   downstream_cx_total, Counter, Total connections
   downstream_cx_destroy_remote_active_rq, Counter, Total connections destroyed remotely with 1+ active requests
   downstream_rq_total, Counter, Total requests

.. _config_http_conn_man_stats_per_listener:

Per listener statistics
-----------------------

Additional per listener statistics are rooted at *listener.<address>.http.<stat_prefix>.* with the
following statistics:

.. csv-table::
   :header: Name, Type, Description
   :widths: 1, 1, 2

   downstream_rq_1xx, Counter, Total 1xx responses
   downstream_rq_2xx, Counter, Total 2xx responses
   downstream_rq_3xx, Counter, Total 3xx responses
   downstream_rq_4xx, Counter, Total 4xx responses
   downstream_rq_5xx, Counter, Total 5xx responses

.. _config_http_conn_man_stats_per_codec:

Per codec statistics
-----------------------

Each codec has the option of adding per-codec statistics. Currently only http2 has codec stats.

Http2 codec statistics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All http2 statistics are rooted at *http2.*


.. csv-table::
   :header: Name, Type, Description
   :widths: 1, 1, 2

   rx_reset, Counter, Total number of reset stream frames received by Envoy.
   tx_reset, Counter, Total number of reset stream frames transmitted by Envoy.
   header_overflow, Counter, Total number of connections reset due to the headers being larger than `Envoy::Http::Http2::ConnectionImpl::StreamImpl::MAX_HEADER_SIZE` (63k).
   trailers, Counter, Total number of trailers seen on requests coming from downstream.
   headers_cb_no_stream, Counter, Total number of errors where a header callback is called without an associated stream. This tracks an unexpected occurrence due to an as yet undiagnosed bug.
   too_many_header_frames, Counter, Total number of times an HTTP2 connection is reset due to receiving too many headers frames. Envoy currently supports proxying at most one header frame for 100-Continue one non-100 response code header frame and one frame with trailers.
