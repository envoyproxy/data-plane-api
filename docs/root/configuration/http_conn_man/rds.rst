Route discovery service (RDS)
=============================

The route discovery service (RDS) API is an optional API that Envoy will call to dynamically fetch
:ref:`route configurations <config_http_conn_man_route_table>`. A route configuration includes both
HTTP header modifications, virtual hosts, and the individual route entries contained within each
virtual host. Each :ref:`HTTP connection manager filter <config_http_conn_man>` can independently
fetch its own route configuration via the API.

* :ref:`v2 API reference <v2_grpc_streaming_endpoints>`

Statistics

RDS has a statistics tree rooted at *http.<stat_prefix>.rds.<route_config_name>.*.
Any ``:`` character in the ``route_config_name`` name gets replaced with ``_`` in the
stats tree. The stats tree contains the following statistics:
