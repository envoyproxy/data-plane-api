.. _config_http_conn_man_route_table_vhost:

Virtual host
============

The top level element in the routing configuration is a virtual host. Each virtual host has
a logical name as well as a set of domains that get routed to it based on the incoming request's
host header. This allows a single listener to service multiple top level domain path trees. Once a
virtual host is selected based on the domain, the routes are processed in order to see which
upstream cluster to route to or whether to perform a redirect.

    "name": "...",
    "domains": [],

    "require_ssl": "...",
    "virtual_clusters": [],

    "request_headers_to_add": []
  }

name
  *(required, string)* The logical name of the virtual host. This is used when emitting certain
  statistics but is not relevant for forwarding. By default, the maximum length of the name is
  limited to 60 characters. This limit can be increased by setting the
  :option:`--max-obj-name-len` command line argument to the desired value.

domains
  *(required, array)* A list of domains (host/authority header) that will be matched to this
  virtual host. Wildcard hosts are supported in the form of "\*.foo.com" or "\*-bar.foo.com".
  Note that the wildcard will not match the empty string. e.g. "\*-bar.foo.com" will match
  "baz-bar.foo.com" but not "-bar.foo.com". Additionally, a special entry "\*" is allowed
  which will match any host/authority header. Only a single virtual host in the entire route
  configuration can match on "\*". A domain must be unique across all virtual hosts or the config
  will fail to load.

:ref:`routes <config_http_conn_man_route_table_route>`
  *(required, array)* The list of routes that will be matched, in order, for incoming requests.
  The first route that matches will be used.

:ref:`cors <config_http_conn_man_route_table_cors>`
  *(optional, object)* Specifies the virtual host's CORS policy.

.. _config_http_conn_man_route_table_vhost_require_ssl:

require_ssl
  *(optional, string)* Specifies the type of TLS enforcement the virtual host expects. Possible
  values are:

  all
    All requests must use TLS. If a request is not using TLS, a 302 redirect will be sent telling
    the client to use HTTPS.

  external_only
    External requests must use TLS. If a request is external and it is not using TLS, a 302 redirect
    will be sent telling the client to use HTTPS.

  If this option is not specified, there is no TLS requirement for the virtual host.

:ref:`virtual_clusters <config_http_conn_man_route_table_vcluster>`
  *(optional, array)* A list of virtual clusters defined for this virtual host. Virtual clusters
  are used for additional statistics gathering.

:ref:`rate_limits <config_http_conn_man_route_table_rate_limit_config>`
  *(optional, array)* Specifies a set of rate limit configurations that will be applied to the
  virtual host.

.. _config_http_conn_man_route_table_vhost_add_req_headers:

request_headers_to_add
  *(optional, array)* Specifies a list of HTTP headers that should be added to each
  request handled by this virtual host. Headers are specified in the following form:

  .. code-block:: json

    [
      {"key": "header1", "value": "value1"},
      {"key": "header2", "value": "value2"}
    ]

  For more information see the documentation on :ref:`custom request headers
  <config_http_conn_man_headers_custom_request_headers>`.
