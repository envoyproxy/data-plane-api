Extending Envoy for custom use cases
====================================

The Envoy architecture makes it fairly easily extensible via both :ref:`network filters
<arch_overview_network_filters>` and :ref:`HTTP filters <arch_overview_http_filters>`.

An example of how to add a network filter and structure the repository and build dependencies can
be found at `envoy-filter-example <https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy-filter-example>`_.
