// have the same structure as their singleton xDS counterparts, but can
// multiplex many resource types on a single stream. The type_url in the
// DiscoveryRequest/DiscoveryResponse provides sufficient information to recover
// the multiplexed singleton APIs at the Envoy instance and management server.
