  // Advanced API to allow for multi-dimensional load balancing by remote
  // server. For receiving LB assignments, the steps are:
  // 1, The management server is configured with per cluster/zone/load metric
  //    capacity configuration. The capacity configuration definition is
  //    outside of the scope of this document.
  // 2. Envoy issues a standard {Stream,Fetch}Endpoints request for the clusters
  //    to balance.
  //
  // Independently, Envoy will initiate a StreamLoadStats bidi stream with a
  // management server:
  // 1. Once a connection establishes, the management server publishes a
  //    LoadStatsResponse for all clusters it is interested in learning load
  //    stats about.
  // 2. For each cluster, Envoy load balances incoming traffic to upstream hosts
  //    based on per-zone weights and/or per-instance weights (if specified)
  //    based on intra-zone LbPolicy. This information comes from the above
  //    {Stream,Fetch}Endpoints.
  // 3. When upstream hosts reply, they optionally add header <define header
  //    name> with ASCII representation of EndpointLoadMetricStats.
  // 4. Envoy aggregates load reports over the period of time given to it in
  //    LoadStatsResponse.load_reporting_interval. This includes aggregation
  //    stats Envoy maintains by itself (total_requests, rpc_errors etc.) as
  //    well as load metrics from upstream hosts.
  // 5. When the timer of load_reporting_interval expires, Envoy sends new
  //    LoadStatsRequest filled with load reports for each cluster.
  // 6. The management server uses the load reports from all reported Envoys
  //    from around the world, computes global assignment and prepares traffic
  //    assignment destined for each zone Envoys are located in. Goto 2.
