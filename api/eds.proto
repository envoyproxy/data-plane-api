  // Advanced API to allow for multi-dimensional load balancing by remote
  // server. The steps are:
  // 1, The management server is configured with per cluster/zone/load metric
  //    capacity configuration. The capacity configuration definition is
  //    outside of the scope of this document.
  // 2. Envoy issues LoadAssignmentRequest for a list of clusters it wants to load
  //    balance to (instead of using a basic EndpointDiscoveryRequest).
  // 3. Once a connection establishes, the management server publishes
  //    LoadAssignmentResponse for all clusters requested in the first
  //    LoadAssignmentRequest. This message contains per cluster/per Locality
  //    information.
  // 4. For each cluster, Envoy load balances incoming traffic to upstream hosts
  //    based on per-zone weights and/or per-instance weights (if specified)
  //    based on intra-zone LbPolicy.
  // 5. When upstream hosts reply, they optionally add header <define header
  //    name> with ASCII representation of EndpointLoadMetricStats.
  // 6. Envoy aggregates load reports over the period of time given to it in
  //    LoadAssignmentResponse.load_reporting_interval. This includes aggregation
  //    stats Envoy maintains by itself (total_requests, rpc_errors etc.) as
  //    well as load metrics from upstream hosts.
  // 7. When the timer of load_reporting_interval expires, Envoy sends new
  //    LoadAssignmentRequest filled with load reports for each cluster.
  // 8. The management server uses the load reports from all reported Envoys
  //    from around the world, computes global assignment and prepares traffic
  //    assignment destined for each zone Envoys are located in. Goto 3.
