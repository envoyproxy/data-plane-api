// period of time, and typically cover a single request/response exchange,
// (e.g. HTTP), stream (e.g. over HTTP/gRPC), or proxied connection (e.g. TCP).
// Access logs contain fields defined in protocol-specific protobuf messages.

// *downstream* interaction between Envoy and a connected client.
// Fields describing *upstream* interaction will explicitly include ``upstream``
// in their name.
