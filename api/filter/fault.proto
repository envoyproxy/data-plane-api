// partitions, etc. Faults injection can be limited to a specific set of
// requests based on the (destination) upstream cluster of a request and/or
// a set of pre-defined request headers.

// The scope of failures is restricted to those that are observable by an
// application communicating over the network. CPU and disk failures on the
// local host cannot be emulated.

//
// * Abort codes are restricted to HTTP status codes only
// * Delays are restricted to fixed duration.
//
// Future versions will include support for restricting faults to specific
// routes, and delay durations based on distributions.
//
// * Note:* The fault injection filter must be inserted before any
// other filter, including the router filter.
